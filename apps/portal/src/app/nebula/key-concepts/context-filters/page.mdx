# Context Filters

Context filters help control what blockchain data the AI uses to generate responses. 

You can specify:

- Chain IDs – Choose which blockchain networks to pull data from.
- Wallet Address – Focus on a specific wallet’s transactions, balances, and interactions.

Benefits: 

- **More relevant answers:** AI focuses only on the data you care about.
- **Enable Scope**: Keep results relevant to networks and wallets specified.

Example,

```jsx
{
  "context": {
    "chain_ids": ["1"],  // Ethereum network
    "wallet_address": "0x123...abc"  // Specific wallet to analyze
  }
}
```
