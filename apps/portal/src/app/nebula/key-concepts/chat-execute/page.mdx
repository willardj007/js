# Chat & Execute endpoints

The `/chat` endpoint is used for **natural language interactions** with the AI. It allows users to ask questions, get explanations, or retrieve blockchain-related insights, and execute transactions.

The `/execute` endpoint is used for **triggering actual blockchain transactions** through AI-generated execution logic. This endpoint **performs actions** on-chain and is designed to be used without historical context.
